    <div class="content">
      <p>So lately I’ve been consuming leadership literature the way a Labradour consumes… well… anything.
I used to read these kinds of books as an IC but for fun, and I could never compare them to my own experiences because I didn’t any.
Now they’re really starting to hit home, and the two books† that have stuck out to me recently have been:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drive by Dan Pink</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick
Lencioni</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And it’s the first one I want to reflect on today, we’ll get to the other one next time.</p>
<p>Dan (can I call you Dan?) mentions the three ingredients of motivation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Autonomy - the desire to direct our own lives</li>
<li>Mastery - the urge to get better and better at something that matters</li>
<li>Purpose - the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>An engineering manager has a lot of influence in creating an environment where these three things are maximised for their team and reports,
and it’s been the first one that I feel like I’ve been tripping up on.</p>
<p>Autonomy to me, in a software team is, <em>given a goal I get to decide how to get there</em>.
This means less hands on guidance from the EM (less micro-management if you will).
The EM can provide the context and ultimate goal (”The business wants us to release x in November because y”),
but how to get there is the ICs responsibility.
Even if as an EM I am ‘accountable’ for it.</p>
<p>EMs should have input of course (and you bet your ass I do) but to <strong>dictate is demotivating.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I’m learning the difference between responsibility and accountability. It’s fun.</p>
<p>Transitioning from an IC, this is hard because I’m so full of ⚠️ <strong>TECHNICAL OPINIONS</strong> ⚠️ honed over <del>many</del> years of projects,
poor decisions, good decisions, study and experimentation.
To let go, stand back and ‘just’ guide feels like I’m not doing my job.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/images/Opinions.jpg" alt="Keep your opinions to yourself"  />
</p></p>
<p>But I’m starting to realise my job now is to support others doing their job.
So, even though my glorious serverless lambda* driven event sourcing architecture may never see the light of day,
I’m happy to trust the team to come up with a much better solution and feel ownership and direction over the work,
since the result is always better.</p>
<p><strong>— Milly</strong></p>
<p>†Both recommendations by the amazing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahbrowne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hannah
Browne</a></p>
<p>*Just kidding. I would never use lambdas.</p>
